## Change requests:

- [x]  use the Authors@R field and declare Maintainer, Authors and Contributors with their appropriate roles with person() calls. 

- [x]  And add add authors of HI package .

- [x]  And add add authors of HI package .

- [x] Copyrights â€”---- add authors of arms-R.c as ctb. 

- [x]  Add more details about the package functionality and implemented methods

- [x] add references in the description field of the DESCRIPTION file in the form:

1. authors (year) <doi:...>
2. authors (year) <arXiv:...>
3. authors (year, ISBN:...) 

- [x]  Add `\value` to .Rd files regarding exported methods and explain the functions results in the documentation. Write about the structure of the output (class) and also what the output means. (If a function does not return a value, please document that too, e.g.  `\value{No return value, called for side effects}` or similar)

- [x] You write information messages to the console that cannot be easily suppressed. It is more R like to generate objects that can be used to extract the information a user is interested in, and then print() that object.Instead of print()/cat() rather use message()/warning()  or if(verbose)cat(..) (or maybe stop()) if you really have to write text to the console.(except for print, summary, interactive functions) 

- [x] Omit any default path in writing functions.  examples/vignettes/tests you can write to tempdir(). e.g.: R/multipleplot.r ; R/singleplot.r   Do not change the user's options, par or working directory. If you really have to do so within functions, please ensure with an *immediate* call of on.exit() that the settings are reset when the function is exited. e.g.:R/multipleplot.r ; R/singleplot.r
