## Change requests:


- [x] put references in the description

- [x] Author@R' -> 'Authors@R
- [x] Ensure that we do not change the user's options, par or working directory. Use on.exit() function before change par. Add the following lines of code at the beginning of the functions. 
```
<plot_function> <- function(){
   oldpar <- par(no.readonly = TRUE) # code line i
   on.exit(par(oldpar)) # code line i + 1
   â€¦
   return()
}

```

- [x] Please always make sure to reset to user's options(), working directory or par() after you changed it in examples and vignettes and demos.

```
oldpar <- par(no.readonly = TRUE)
<plot function call, such as 
plot(single.OR.Jeffreys, type="overlap", xlim=c(0.5, 2),
    main="Jefferys Prior")
>
par(oldpar)
```
